CIFAR-10 CNN Training Project

Requirements / What Was Needed at the Beginning

Before starting the project, the following were required:
	•	Python 3.9+
	•	A working virtual environment (venv)
	•	Installed Python packages:
	•	torch
	•	torchvision
	•	macOS (important for DataLoader behavior)
	•	CIFAR-10 dataset (downloaded automatically or stored locally)
	•	A custom CNN model implemented in mycnn.py (SimpleCNN)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision

Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:
	•	Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset
	•	Correctly handle training and validation data
	•	Follow PyTorch best practices
	•	Avoid common macOS multiprocessing issues

⸻

Dataset Handling
	•	Dataset used: CIFAR-10
	•	Total images: 60,000
	•	50,000 training images
	•	10,000 test images

Data Split Strategy
	•	The original training set is split into:
	•	90% training
	•	10% validation
	•	The test set is kept separate and untouched for final evaluation

Implementation uses:
	•	torch.utils.data.random_split
	•	Separate DataLoader instances for train and validation

⸻

Data Loading Details (macOS Fix)
	•	On macOS, PyTorch uses spawn instead of fork
	•	This causes crashes when using multiprocessing without protection
	•	Solution applied:
	•	num_workers = 0 in all DataLoaders
	•	This ensures stable execution during development

⸻

Model
	•	Custom CNN defined in mycnn.py
	•	Model outputs 10 classes (CIFAR-10)
	•	Moved to available device:
	•	CUDA if available
	•	CPU otherwise

⸻

Training Setup
	•	Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss
	•	Optimizer: Adam
	•	Learning rate: 1e-3
	•	Number of epochs: 5
	•	Input normalization applied to CIFAR-10 images

⸻

Training & Validation Loop

For each epoch:
	•	Training phase
	•	model.train()
	•	Gradients enabled
	•	Weights updated
	•	Validation phase
	•	model.eval()
	•	torch.no_grad()
	•	No weight updates
	•	Metrics computed:
	•	Training loss
	•	Training accuracy
	•	Validation loss
	•	Validation accuracy

All metrics are printed after each epoch.

⸻

Current Project State
	•	✅ Training loop implemented
	•	✅ Validation loop implemented
	•	✅ Proper dataset split
	•	✅ macOS multiprocessing issue resolved
	•	⏳ Test set evaluation (can be added next)
	•	⏳ Early stopping / checkpoints (optional extensions)

⸻

Possible Next Steps
	•	Add final test evaluation
	•	Implement early stopping
	•	Save best-performing model
	•	Add learning rate scheduler
	•	Plot training vs validation curves
